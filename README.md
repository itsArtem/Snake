# Snake
A simple snake game I made a while ago. Code may not be the best, don't really remember it.

## Setting Up
Start off by cloning the repository. Once you've done that, you can open the solution file using Visual Studio.
If you want to use another IDE, you're gonna have to manually set up the required project files you need.
The game is cross-platform, but the included dependencies may not work for your platform or compiler.
